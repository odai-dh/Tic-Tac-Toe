# Tic-Tac-Toe
Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe Game! This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can play against a friend or soon, against a robust AI opponent with different difficulty levels. The game is designed with a sleek and modern user interface that Iâ€™m constantly working to improve.
